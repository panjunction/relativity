= relativity v0.1a

relativity is search engine for ruby_on_rails applications.
It uses a NoSQL Key-Value store to create searchable records.
It is a modified copy of the data stored in your main database (MySQL, etc).
It is read-only (not for storage and editing).

== Example

item.rb
  class Item << ActiveRecord:Base
    relativity_search_records do
      string :name
    end
  end

irb:
  Item.create!({:name => "Test Item", :properties => {:height => "6 feet", :width => "24 inches"}})
  Item.search_by_key(:height, "6 feet") # [ Item(1) ]
  Item.search_by_key(:properties,  {:height => "6 feet", :width => "24 inches"}) # [ Item(1) ]

== Requirements

  ruby >= 1.9.2
  rails >= 3.x
  MongoDB

== Installation

1) Put it in your Gemfile and run `bundle install`
   OR `gem install relativity`

2) rails generate relativity:install

== Usage

In your ActiveRecord model, set the relativity_search_records method:

  class Item < ActiveRecord:Base
    relativity_search_records do
      string :name
    end
  end

Then you can search via the class method `search_by_key`.

== IMPORTANT NOTES

This is a search key-value store, and is in no way a datastore.
It is purely for search records (it modifies some values for easier search.
